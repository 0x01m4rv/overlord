This tool provides a python-based console CLI which is used to build Red Teaming infrastructure in an automated way. The user has to provide inputs by using the tool’s modules (e.g. C2, Email Server, HTTP web delivery server, Phishing server etc.) and the full infra / modules and scripts will be generated automatically on a cloud provider of choice. Currently supports AWS and Digital Ocean. The tool is still under development and it was inspired and uses the [Red-Baron](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/Red-Baron) Terraform implementation found on Github. 

It was only tested on Kali Linux but it probably work on all Linux x64 systems.
# Installation

```bash
git clone overlord /opt/overlord
cd /opt/overlord/config
./install.sh
```
# Documentation
## Projects
Overlord has build in functionality for project management. From the cli you can manage each project by loading the configuration file with the `load` command. When you deploy the project again, the modifications will be pushed to the providers. For more information visit the [Help](#help).
## Supported Providers
  - Digital Ocean
  - AWS
  - Godaddy
## Variables
The `set` command can be used to initialize the API keys to communicate with the providers. The  domains variable can be used  to add domain names into the overlord project.
```
aws_access_key        aws_secret_key        domains               dotoken               godaddy_access_key    godaddy_secret_key
```
The `./projects/variables.json` can be used to auto load the keys used to authenticate with each of the supported providers and the domain names. When you first set the arguments into your campaign you can save them using the `set variables` command which will create the `variables.json` file. 
## Modules

## Advanced Configuration

### Installation Templates
In the c2 module the user has the ability to install tools from a list. The tool automatically loads the scripts from the `./redbaron/data/scripts/tools`. By adding a new script in the directory, you can install by the `tools` variable in the c2 module.

### Default Configuration File
The `./config/config.json` file contains the default configuration on each module and the providers that are used by overlord. By changing each object, you can customize the default values of each module when it loads to Overlord.
```json
    // Default
    "mod_c2": {
        "module": "c2",
        "type" : "http",
        "redirectors": 1,
        "tools": [],
        "region": "LON1",
        "provider": "digitalocean",
        "size": "s-1vcpu-1gb",
        "id": ""
    }

    // Customized
    "mod_c2": {
        "module": "c2",
        "type" : "http",
        "redirectors": 0,
        "tools": ["metasploit","empire"],
        "region": "us-east-2",
        "provider": "aws",
        "size": "t2.nano",
        "id": ""
    }
```

# RedBaron
**Red Baron only supports Terraform version 0.11 and will only work on Linux x64 systems. We will try to update it to support newer versions as well on a later phase.** 

For more information on how to modify the terraform modules and about the Red Baron project visit the following [Link](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/Red-Baron).

## Notes
### Firewall rules
Overlord does not support adding new firewall rules from the CLI at the current time. You can add or remove rules from the RedBaron modules directory on the Terraform code or after the installation of each provider (i.e. manually via the cloud provider's web interface).
